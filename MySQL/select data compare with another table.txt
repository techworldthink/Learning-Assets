$dev_all = "SELECT * FROM pending_alert WHERE pending_alert.id=(SELECT id FROM io_settings WHERE user='$user') ORDER BY ID $order LIMIT $count";



When subquery returns more than 1 value, you will have to use IN:

$dev_all = "SELECT name,user FROM user_details WHERE user IN(SELECT user_id FROM user_login WHERE user_athorization='0110')";
